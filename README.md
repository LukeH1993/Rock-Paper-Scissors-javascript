# JavaScript Rock Paper Scissors

This simple JavaScript rock paper scissors was a practise program I created when I first started learning web development with JavaScript.

## Purpose

The purpose of this program is to randomly generate rock, paper, scissors between two players. If the player gets 'rocked', then they lose and the person playing rock wins. Paper can be 'scissored', meaning that the player who plays scissors wins. The game will notify the users who has won and who has lost.
